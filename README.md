## Parts of Speech Cheat Sheet!

Mad libs rely on your knowing a little bit about a few parts of speech. If you're like me, you're always forgetting which ones are which! These are the more common ones used in mad libs:

**adjective:** describes, modifies, or gives more information about a noun or a pronoun (cold, happy, young, etc.)

**noun:** name of a thing, a person, an animal, a place, or an idea (Daniel, London, table, hope)

**verb:** shows an action or a state of being (go, speaking, lived, been, listen)

**adverb:** modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. It tells how, where, when (slowly, very, always, quickly)
